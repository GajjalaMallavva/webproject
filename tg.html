                <p><h2 style="text-align:center">These waterfalls are in the dense forests inhabited by the Gonds. Kunta in Gondi and Telugu means pond. 
                    Kuntalu means several ponds. The waterfall originates from a confluence of several ponds that lead to the river Kadem.The Kuntala Waterfalls is located 12 kms from the Neredikonda villege, about 64 km from Adilabad. 
                    At Kuntala,the Kadem river cascades 45 meters down and rushes deep into the Jungles. Kuntala, the highest waterfalls in the State, offers a spectacular sight particularly when the river is flush with copious inflows.
                     The winter months are ideal for witnessing the waterfalls, as one can also see the river in all its glory. There is an image of Lord Shiva near the water falls known as Someshwara Swami. Many devotees congregate here for Maha Shiva Ratri festivities.

                        <p><h2 style="text-align:center">The Pochera waterfall has an emerald, green colored tinge, due to the granite rock bed. Situated amidst dense forests, this waterfall is a popular tourist attraction in Telangana.The fall is 20 meter high and flows down with a great force, and the falls are categorized as plunge waterfalls. 
                            The holy river Godavari flows through the Sahyadri mountain range and on their way, the river breaks into small streams. Some of these streams escape from their path and meet at a point and become the source for the Pochera falls which falls from a 20 meters high point. The bed is much deeper and has the capacity to hold a very huge quantity of water.
                            Pochera Waterfalls is located at a distance of nearly 37 km from Nirmal town, 47 km from Adilabad town and 7 km from Boath and accessible by road.</h2></p>
