                        <p><h2 style="text-align:center">Kempty Falls is a waterfall in Ram Gaon and at the south of Kempty, in the Tehri Garhwal District of Uttarakhand, India. 
                            It is 13 kilometres (8 mi) from Mussoorie on the Chakrata Road, and 45 kilometres (28 mi) from Dehradun.Kempty Falls were developed as a tourist destination by British officer John Mekinan, around 1835. 
                            The name Kempty is probably derived from the word 'camp-tea'. A stream of water running throughout the year starting from the southwest of the village of Banglow ki kandi moves northwest and falls from 4,500 ft. 
                            Splitting into five other cascades, the water falls a further 40 feet.</h2>
