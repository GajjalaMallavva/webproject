                <p><h2 style="text-align:center">Located about 3 km from Waghai town, the Gira waterfall is a 30 m natural drop into the Ambica River.
                    Also known as Giradudh, Gira Waterfall is formed over the Kapri River and eventually drops into the Ambika River. 
                    The height of the falls is about 75 feet and the speed of the water plunging into the river creates a foggy look giving it a charming feel. 
                    The Gira Falls is a favorite among the tourists who visit this area as part of Saputara tour. The place has now developed into a great picnic spot.
