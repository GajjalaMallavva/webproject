                             It is located in Vanva river near Thenzawl and is named after Vantawnga who was said to be an excellent swimmer. So good a swimmer was Vantawnga that he could hover in the cascading water like a fish, but unfortunately during one of such performances, a drifting log fell from above and killed him.</h2></p>
