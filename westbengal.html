                         Actually the shape of the canyon is like a kalash. Tharafeni dam is very closed to Ghagra.Tarafeni and Ghagra waterfallTarafeni Barrage under Belpahari Gram Panchayat is definitely an more attractive place where public get enthralled at the sight of atractive nature and of the river currents against the rocky boulders, during rainy season.
                         It is at a distance of nearly 5 k.m.away from Belpahari. </h2>

                        <p><h2 style="text-align:center">One of the major attractions of Darjeeling, the main highlight of this garden is the Chunnu summer falls. Built by the Gorkha Hill Council Tourism Department, this place was named the rock garden because the entire place is made out of cutting rocks from different levels.
                            Chunnu Summer falls can be reached from Darjeeling via rented cars from Darjeeling town. It is approximately 10 kilometers from the town of Darjeeling. While proceeding downhill from Darjeeling via the Hill Cart Road, one has to turn right, a little before reaching Ghoom Station. Albeit the road is narrow and descends rapidly into the valley, after you pass across a few households and a couple of sharp turns into the valley you would be in for surreal landscapes .
