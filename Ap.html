                        <p><h2 style="text-align:center">The blissful waterfalls of  Akasa Ganga is one of the most sacred waterfronts in India and lies at the foothills of Venkatadri Tirumala. 
                            Visited by everyone who comes to seek the blessings of Lord Venkateshwara, the presiding deity of the city, the waterfall provides water for the Lord's bath as well. 
                            The place has been mentioned in the Vedas and it is believed that the falls originated from the holy feet of Lord Venkateshwara. It is said that in the earlier days, the priests of the temple carried water from here to the temple in the wee hours of the morning. 
                            This custom is still in play but restricted to special occasions only. Lately, water lines were laid into the temple to carry water from the Akasa Ganga.</h2> </p>
