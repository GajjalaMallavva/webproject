                <p><h2 style="text-align:center">Nohkalikai Falls is the tallest plunge waterfall in India. Its height is 340 metres (1,115 ft).
                    The waterfall is located in the Indian state of Meghalaya, near Cherapunji (now known as Sohra), one of the wettest places on Earth.
                     Nohkalikai Falls are fed by the rainwater collected on the summit of a comparatively small plateau and decrease in power during the dry season, from December to February. 
                     Below the falls is a plunge pool with water of an unusual shade of green.</h2></p>

                    <p><h2 style="text-align:center">Krang Suri is located on the other side of the state and takes a while to get to. 
                        It is 91 kms from Shillong and should typically should take 2.5 hours according to Google. But hey, these are mountains and the winding roads will stretch your time by a hour.
                         So budget 3.5 hours to reach this place. The roads are deserted with nothing but some small villages on the way and some crazy looking limestone quarries.</h2></p>

                        <p><h2 style="text-align:center">Elephant Falls is situated at the outskirts of the main city of Shillong in the East Khasi Hills District, Upper Shillong. It is almost 12 km away from the Shillong city center.
                            The first fall of Elephant Falls is an example of a horsetail-punchbowl waterfall. The first fall is very broad and is hidden among trees. The second fall however, is quite domesticated and in the winters (and drier months) looks inconsequential. 
                            The third fall is the tallest and comes to view suddenly and looks most spectacular with crystal clear water falling over sharp rocks of myriad shapes.</h2></p>
