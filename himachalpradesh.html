                        It is one of the famous waterfalls in Himachal, and among the popular places to visit in Manali. Jogini Fall is formed by the tributary of the Beas River. 
                        Jogini Falls is situated on the Northern edge of Vashisht Village which marks the village boundary. The waterfall cascades down from a height of around 150 feet through multiple levels.

                        <p><h2 style="text-align:center">The stunning Rahala Falls is located at a height of 8,500 ft and about 16 km from Manali. It is located on the way to Rohtang Pass and whoever visits the Rohtang valley makes a halt at Rahala Falls to enjoy the scenic beauty of the place. 
                            One can click pictures, trek above the cliff and enjoy the melting ice of this fall. The Rahala waterfall is a result of melting glacier, and so the water of this fall is extremely cold. This fall is set amidst dense forest of deodar, silver birch trees, and fresh and aromatic air.
                             This place is easily accessible from Manali and one can take a bus, car, bike, or pony to reach the spot. The view of the place is really attention-grabbing and it gives mental peace to the visitors. The pleasant weather and the marvelous surroundings make it one of the best attractions in Manali.</h2></p>
